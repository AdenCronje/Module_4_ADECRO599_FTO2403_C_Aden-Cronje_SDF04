DESIGN PROCESS
The main goal of the project was to style 3 unique buttons. This was achieved by using different animation and transition properties.
Most of my inspirations came from different youtube tutorials and the reference provided from CodePen.

CHALLENGES
My main area of struggles came from using the animation properties, this led me to change my .btn-2 design a few times.
This eventually led me to settling on just using the transiton property, which I found the easisest to understand 
and execute in my code.
